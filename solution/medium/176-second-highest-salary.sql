-- Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Employee table:
-- +----+--------+
-- | id | salary |
-- +----+--------+
-- | 1  | 100    |
-- | 2  | 200    |
-- | 3  | 300    |
-- +----+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +---------------------+
-- | SecondHighestSalary |
-- +---------------------+
-- | 200                 |
-- +---------------------+

-- Solution
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
